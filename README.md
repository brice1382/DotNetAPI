# DotNetAPI
Simple User API using ASP.NET MVC, WebAPI and Entity Framework. A couple Linq to SQL queries but mainly Entity Framework 6. 
This is the server side code only and doesn't have any views, just meant for the API Endpoints. Variations of this API are in 
use on a few different sites that I have written and are currently hosting.

# Use
Download the API and open it in the IDE of your choice, I wrote it with JetBrains Rider EAP but usually use it with 
Visual Studio 2017. Put a front end on it, I usually use AngularJS, and point your calls to the endpoints provided in
the API and you are set, in theory.
